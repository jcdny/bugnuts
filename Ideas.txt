Gradient search on encountered enemies.
Repulsion on ants to increase spread
Threat on hill possibly weighted by precomputed bfs dist and upweight coordinated attacks
greedy step by unk + visible land + overall visibility
avoidance scaling - avoid early while few ants gathering and scouting.
count of ants vs food gotten so can decide whether to plug holes on multi hole version based on threat
array of how much visible/reachable dirt at each point out to 5 steps
goal chaining - ie if I am next to an ant and I want to move into its square to achieve my goal I pass my goal to it.
clump rounds to make my ants less subject to the line of eating.
pathfind out of hill to a rally point.  rally point determined by safety???
cat map type as maze or random and pathfind differently?
death avoidance - count deads I see and avoid danger when scouting.


PERF:

arrays mapping whfa <-> byte
arrays mapping byte -> threat
arrays mapping byte -> value
dirt=1
unk=3
w=0
f=60
h=50
a=-2


PRI:

gather food
max explore + visible dirt
avoid enemies
