Gradient search on encountered enemies.  

Repulsion on ants

Threat on hill

step by unk + visible land + overall visibility

avoidance scaling - avoid early while scouting.

count of ants vs food gotten so can decide whether to plug holes on multi hole version.

array of how much visible dirt at each point.

goal chaining - ie if I am next to an ant and I want to move into its square to achieve my goal I pass my goal to it.

clump rounds to make my ants less subject to the line of eating.

pathfind out of hill to a rally point.  rally point determined by safety???

cat map type as maze or random and pathfind differently?

death avoidance - count deads I see and avoid danger when scouting.


PERF:

h=50
a=-2


PRI:

gather food
max explore + visible dirt
avoid enemies
